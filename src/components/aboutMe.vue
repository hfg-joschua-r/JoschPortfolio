        <i>Hello! My name is Josch and I enjoy creating things that simultaneouly
        live on the internet and in the real world.</i> <br><br> I got into programming
        during a year-round internship in 2016. During this time I first learned 
        how to program <b>Arduino and C++,</b> later on I focused on <b>Unity and VR development.</b><br>
        After I finished my A-levels in 2019, I completed an internship as a software
        developer at Widerstand und Söhne in Ulm, where I got deeper into <b>C#, Unity and Nodejs.</b><br>
        I am currently studying <a href="https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/studium/internet-der-dinge">digital product design and development</a> at the HfG in Schwäbisch Gmünd.
